Vet visits. Thunderstorms. Boarding. Parties. These are just a handful of times when Calming chews may come in handy. Does your dog hate to be left home alone? Does your cat love hiding under the bed? Serve up a Calming chew to help soothe your furry pal’s anxiety and make your life easier, too!</p><span class="calm__subtitle">For Best Results:</span><p class="calm__text">We recommend administering Calming chews 30 minutes prior to a stressful event. The 30-minute activation period gives you a chance to increase dosage if you’re not seeing expected results. Calming is safe for unique stress inducing events and for long-term use to help manage everyday stress.</p><!-- </div> --></div><div class="calm__img-box"><img class="calm__img" src="img/calm-img1.webp" alt="A cat with a doctor"></div></div></div></section>
